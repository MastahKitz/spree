# Task: analyze this CI run's Playwright failures and propose next steps

This is a post-merge run against the live demo storefront. Some test(s) failed (or were flaky —
passed only after retry, which we also treat as a build failure). Your job is **triage, not
fixing**: figure out, per failure, whether it looks like a real product bug or a problem with the
test script itself, avoid re-reporting failures that are already tracked, and propose a concrete
next step. A human approves or declines your suggestions afterward — never edit test logic, only
ever add/update the known-failure marker comments described below, and only ever land those via a
PR, never by pushing to main directly.

Your tool access here is deliberately narrow (only `Read`/`Grep`/`Glob`/`Edit` and a short list of
specific `git`/`gh` subcommands — no general `Bash`, no `jq`, no `python3`, no piped/chained shell
commands). Everything you need is reachable with the allowed tools; reach for those directly rather
than probing for `jq`, `python3 -c`, `gh run view`, or shell pipes — those aren't granted here and
attempting them just burns turns on denied calls instead of doing the actual analysis. In
particular: read `test-report/results.json` and the `.png` screenshots directly with `Read` (it
parses JSON and renders images natively — you don't need `jq`/`python3` to walk the JSON structure
described below), and use `Grep`/`Glob` for anything you'd otherwise reach for `find`/`grep`/`cat`
to do. You already have the RUN ID/URL/COMMIT from the prompt below, so there's no need to look up
run metadata via `gh run view` either.

## Evidence available

- `test-report/results.json` — the Playwright JSON reporter output for this run. Walk `suites` →
  `specs` → `tests` to find every test with `status` `unexpected` (failed) or `flaky`. Each entry
  has the error message, stack trace (including the failing file:line), and expected/actual
  snippets where relevant.
- `test-results/**/test-failed-*.png` — a screenshot of the page at the moment of failure, one per
  failed attempt. **You must open and read this screenshot for every failing/flaky test before
  forming a theory of the root cause.** Look specifically for anything overlaid on the page —
  modal dialogs, popups, toasts, banners, alert text — as well as error banners, empty cart, wrong
  price, blank page, etc. If a popup or banner has visible text, transcribe it verbatim into your
  analysis; this is direct evidence of what happened and takes priority over any theory built
  purely from reading/comparing code paths.
- `test-results/**/video-frames/frame-*.png` — frames sampled at 2fps from that attempt's video
  recording (pre-extracted by the workflow; the raw `.webm` next to them is not readable by you, so
  don't try to open it directly). **If the single failure screenshot looks unremarkable — a normal,
  static-looking page with nothing obviously wrong — check these frames before concluding there was
  no error.** The screenshot is one instant in time; this app shows some errors as toasts/popups
  that appear a moment after an action and self-dismiss a few seconds later, so a transient error
  can easily be gone by the time the failure screenshot fires while still being visible across
  several consecutive video frames. Skim frames in order for anything that appears and then
  vanishes — that's the signal, not what's on screen at the last frame.
- The test source itself: use Grep/Glob to find the failing spec under `tests/functional/**` and
  read its `.spec.ts`, `.flow.ts`, `.actions.ts`, and `.assertions.ts` siblings to understand what
  was actually being checked and how. Use this to understand the flow, but do not let it override
  what the screenshot actually shows — a plausible-looking code-path explanation (e.g. "a
  preceding step was skipped") is not a substitute for confirming, from the screenshot, what state
  the page was actually in when the failure occurred.

## Step 1 — check for an existing marker before treating a failure as new

Known failures are tracked with a marker comment placed on the line immediately above the
assertion/action that failed, in this exact format:

```
// KNOWN-FAILURE(#123): <short reason> — retriage if this changes
```

For each failing/flaky test from `results.json`, open the file:line from its stack trace and check
the line directly above it:

- **No marker present** → this is a new failure. Go to Step 2.
- **Marker present, and `gh issue view <N> --json state` shows it's still open** → already
  tracked, do not file another issue and do not touch the marker. Just note it in your final
  summary as "already tracked as #N".
- **Marker present, but the linked issue is closed** → this is a regression (supposedly fixed,
  failing again). Treat it as new: go to Step 2, and in Step 3 replace the stale marker with one
  pointing at the new issue instead of leaving the old (wrong) one in place.

## Step 2 — classify each new/regressed failure

1. **What was being asserted** (in plain English).
2. **What actually happened**, grounded in the screenshot for that failure (not just the error
   message/stack) — state plainly what was on screen, including any popup/dialog/banner text.
3. **A classification**:
   - **Likely product bug** — the app behaved incorrectly; the test caught something real.
   - **Likely script issue** — the test itself is wrong or brittle (stale locator, wrong
     assumption, timing/flake in the test's own waiting, hardcoded data that changed), not a
     product problem.
   - **Inconclusive** — not enough evidence to tell; say what additional info would resolve it.
4. **A suggested action item** — specific enough to act on, e.g. "update the `getByRole(...)`
   locator in `checkout.actions.ts` — the button's accessible name changed from X to Y" or "file a
   bug: adding a second item does not update the cart subtotal." Not "investigate further" unless
   truly inconclusive.

For each new/regressed failure, create a GitHub issue (`gh issue create`) titled
`<test title> — <file>` containing the four points above and a link to the run (the RUN URL given
to you in the prompt). Note the issue number it returns — you'll need it for Step 3.

## Step 3 — open one PR with the marker comments

If you filed one or more issues in Step 2:

1. `git checkout -b qa/known-failures-run-<RUN ID>` (RUN ID given to you in the prompt).
2. `git config user.name` / `user.email` to a bot identity, e.g. `qa-triage-bot` /
   `qa-triage-bot@users.noreply.github.com`.
3. For each new/regressed failure, add (or replace the stale) `KNOWN-FAILURE(#N)` marker comment
   on the line above the failing assertion/action, using the issue number you just created.
4. Commit only these marker-comment lines (no other changes), push the branch, and
   `gh pr create` titled `Mark known QA failures (run #<RUN ID>)` with a body listing each
   failure, its classification, and the issue it links to.

If every failure in this run was already tracked (all markers pointed at open issues), skip
issue/PR creation entirely and just report that in your final response — don't manufacture work.

If, after investigating, you find no actual failing/flaky tests (e.g. the build failed for an
unrelated infra reason), say so instead of filing anything.
